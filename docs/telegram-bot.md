# Add a Download via Telegram Bot

With the Telegram bot integration, you can add downloads directly from your mobile device or any device that has access to Telegram.

#### Steps to Add a Download:
1. Start a chat with your DloadBox bot on Telegram.
2. Send the **download link** of the file you wish to download to the bot.
3. The bot will automatically add the download to the queue, and you will receive a confirmation message with the download's status.
4. You can also track the download's progress via the web interface at the same time.
